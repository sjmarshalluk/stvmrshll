      <h1>Public Health England wanted to identify improvements for their app aimed at improving the baseline health of the nation. </h1>

      


      <p>Public Health England owns a portfolio of apps aimed at making basic lifestyle changes to help improve the health of individuals. I partnered with a UX Researcher to co-run and execute on this short (2 month) project, to explore ways in which one could be improved. Rather than create final, production-ready designs, we were performing exploration to inform future development.</p>

      <h4>Understanding the Status Quo</h4>
      <h1>The first task was to develop an understanding of how users experience the app in it's current state</h1>

      <p>The app we were looking at was their most popular and encouraged daily physical exercise by targeting 10 minutes of moderate activity at a time. As this was an existing app, our first challenge was to gain an understanding of its current state. Unfortunately, there was very little existing information for us to utilize (no analytics or previous user studies), and so set about gathering as broad an understanding as we could using other methods in the time frame.</p>

        <li>Workshops with internal stakeholders to gather knowledge and explore key users and their problems</li>

      <p>As we weren't re-designing the entire app (but rather identify key opportunities for improvement), once we had established an understanding of the current app, we were able identify the our areas of focus.</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Onboarding (we found that there was a steep drop off after app install, so wanted to increase initial usage)</li>
        <li>Movitation (for the users that started using the app, many lost interest quickly)</li>
        <li>Dashboard (with increasing activity tracking apps available, user expectations were to have more insights into the activities they are doing)</li>

      <h4>Rapid, iterative process</h4>

      <h1>To explore potential solutions, we adopted a rapid (daily) iteration approach to ensure best use of time available</h1>

      <p>Due to the short time frame and our collaborative approach, much of the exploration was done through whiteboarding. This allowed us to explore many options very quickly whilst working towards a shared understanding and alignment.</p>

      <p>These whiteboarding sessions formed the structure for a rapid iterative approach. Within each daily session we would identify concepts that required further exploration that would be bought back to the whiteboard the following day (eg higher-fidelity mockups). We repeated this for each area of focus, as well as how each section fit together to ensure a consistent overall UX.</p>

      <h1>With feedback from real users, we were able to iterate on and refine our recommendations to present to the client</h1>



      <h2>Onboarding</h2>

      <p>Through our research and explorations, we identified simplicity as being critical. Due to the nature of the app, the average user was likely to be less technologically adept and was more likely to have other health conditions.</p>

      <p>We reflected this in creating a very simple and clear onboarding. Whilst the final result seems basic, we iterated many times of the order and copy for each screen to ensure every question was answered without ever being overwhelming.</p>

      <p>Side note: visual UI design wasn't really part of our remit, however we opted to present our suggestions with an updated design. This was a refinement of the existing style, and reused (where available) existing assets. We did this to highlight the need to reinvigorate the visuals whilst retaining the familiarity.</p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>

      <p>The existing app gave a boolean experience: you either have reached a goal or not. We wanted to introduce a more engaging form of motivation. Having explored a few options (eg badges, gamification), we hypothesized that progressive levels would be the most effective.</p>

      <p>The proposed implementation of this included a suggested UI, the required targets for each level, as well as options for how 'fun' these levels could be. We liked the idea of playful names (eg "Wannabe Walker"), but it was decided that these didn't fit the overall brand of a government app.</p>

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>

      <p>As with the motivation, users of the existing app were just told if they had achieved the amount of required exercise or not. We proposed a more engaging form of dashboard that visualized their progress for the day, week, month, and year.</p>

      <p>I explored many options for the visualization of the data (see image in process section above for just a few), but we landed on a very simple implementation. We had established that the target market for this app was on the lower end of tech literacy, so the goal was to make the data as simple as possible.</p>
