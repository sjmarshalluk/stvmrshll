  <h1>Reframing Design Systems as Experience Systems to Support Individual Products</h1>

  <p>
    Outside’s portfolio included Gaia GPS, Trailforks, MapMy, and multiple event and editorial products — each with its own onboarding,
    navigation, mapping tools, and UI patterns. Traditional design-system work wasn’t solving the real issue: inconsistent <em>experiences</em> that confused users and slowed teams down.
  </p>

  <p>
    My role was to define a unified, cross-product experience architecture — a system that preserved product individuality while creating predictable, reusable experiences across the ecosystem.
  </p>


  <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Every product team had its own UI library, patterns, and interpretation of core interactions:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Onboarding flows behaved differently across brands.</li>
    <li>Map experiences (recording, following, layer management) varied wildly.</li>
    <li>Event registration and account behaviors were inconsistent.</li>
    <li>A traditional “one design system for all” model wasn’t viable — products had different audiences, tech stacks, and brand identities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We didn’t need a larger design system.  
    We needed a <strong>unified way to design experiences</strong>.
  </p>


  <!-- INSIGHT -->
  <h2>Key Insight: Components Weren’t the Problem — Experiences Were</h2>

  <p>
    In reviewing all Outside products, I decomposed them into three repeatable layers — a pattern clearly visible once the work was mapped across teams and use cases:
  </p>

  <ul class="numbers">
    <li><strong>Common Experiences</strong> (e.g., record a track, follow a route, register for an event)</li>
    <li><strong>Experience Systems</strong> (patterns that shape the behavior and structure of those experiences)</li>
    <li><strong>Design Systems</strong> (visual styling and brand expression applied on top)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The “Deconstructed Design Systems” model I introduced clarified how these layers relate and where consistency should (and should not) be enforced.  
  </p>



  <!-- THE SYSTEM -->
  <h2>The Experience System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    Through synthesis of product reviews, team interviews, and analysis of shared user journeys,
    I introduced a hierarchical, interoperable system:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Global Experience System</strong> — the highest-level rules (e.g., destructive actions require confirmation modals). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
    <li><strong>Experience Systems</strong> for product families:
      <ul class="bullets" style="margin-top: 0.3rem;">
        <li>Core (Accounts, Onboarding, Navigation)</li>
        <li>Maps (Recording, Layers, Following)</li>
        <li>Events (Registration, Results, Check-ins)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Design Systems</strong> for individual brands (Gaia, Trailforks, MapMy, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This structure allowed experiences to stay consistent where it mattered,
    while still letting products express their brand, audience, and technical needs.
  </p>


  <!-- HOW IT WORKED -->
  <h2>How the Model Worked in Practice</h2>

  <p>
    Each experience was defined with:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Interaction principles</strong> (e.g., what triggers a modal, how recording begins/ends)</li>
    <li><strong>Structural patterns</strong> (screen flows, states, error conditions)</li>
    <li><strong>Content rules</strong> (terminology, symbology, conventions)</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-product alignment requirements</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Then each product’s design system <strong>skinned</strong> the experience system using its brand colors,
    typography, components, and tone of voice.  
  </p>



  <!-- OUTCOMES -->
  <h2>Outcomes</h2>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Created the first <strong>cross-product experience architecture</strong> at Outside.</li>
    <li>Enabled product teams to build onboarding, map tools, and event flows using a <strong>shared experiential model</strong>.</li>
    <li>Reduced duplication — teams built once and applied across brands.</li>
    <li>Improved clarity in roadmap planning by separating “experience decisions” from “visual design.”</li>
    <li>Provided a scalable foundation later integrated into the Maps Platform and Onboarding initiatives.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Most importantly, this reframed the role of design systems at Outside — from component libraries to <strong>experience infrastructure</strong>.
