            <h2>01 // The Diagnosis</h2>
            <h3>Measuring the Invisible</h3>
            <p>
                I was initially asked to "look into onboarding" across Outside’s portfolio (Gaia GPS, Trailforks, MapMy). What began as a UX request quickly revealed a structural void.
            </p>
            <p>
                My initial audit exposed that the organization lacked the basic infrastructure to support a cohesive experience:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <li><strong>No Ownership:</strong> No single team was responsible for the user's first 30 days.</li>
                <li><strong>No Definition:</strong> "Activation" was measured differently by every product lead.</li>
                <li><strong>Value Gap:</strong> While marketing promised an "Ecosystem," the products operated as silos.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="figure-container">
                <div class="figure-content">
                     <img src="images/onboarding/analytics.png" alt="Value Reach Rate Data">
                </div>
                <div class="caption">
                    FIG 01. THE DATA AUDIT. I quantified "Value Reach Rate" (users who actually experienced the core utility), revealing drop-offs as high as 58% in products like Trailforks.
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>02 // The Strategy</h2>
            <h3>Reframing the Problem</h3>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <span class="insight-label">The Insight</span>
                <p>
                    "The real onboarding problem wasn't the UI—it was the business definition. We needed to shift from Onboarding as a 'Doorway' (getting them in) to Onboarding as a 'System' (getting them to value)."
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I developed a <strong>Two-Layer Framework</strong> to align the product teams. This separated the technical "setup" from the actual "value discovery."
            </p>

            <div class="figure-container">
                <div class="figure-content">
                    <img src="images/onboarding/framework.png" alt="Onboarding Framework Diagram">
                </div>
                <div class="caption">
                    FIG 02. THE FRAMEWORK. Distinct layers for "Out-of-Box Experience" (Setup) vs. "Ongoing Onboarding" (Value Drip).
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Handling Complexity: The Scenario Matrix</h3>
            <p>
                A "one size fits all" flow was impossible given our diverse user base. I introduced a <strong>Multi-Scenario Model</strong> that dynamically adjusted the onboarding path based on two variables:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> (Free vs. Premium vs. Trial)</li>
                <li><strong>Entry Point:</strong> (Web vs. App Store vs. Referral)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This allowed us to serve a "Hard Sell" flow to App Store downloads, while serving a "Value Reinforcement" flow to users who had already purchased a subscription via the web.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>03 // The Execution</h2>
            <h3>From Abstract to Concrete</h3>
            <p>
                To prove the framework's viability, I translated the high-level strategy into a "Canonical Flow"—a single architectural diagram that defined the required steps for every product in the portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allowed engineering to build a shared backend service while allowing individual brand designers to apply their specific visual language on top of the logic.
            </p>

            <h2>04 // The Impact</h2>
            <h3>Organizational Shift</h3>
            <p>
                While resource constraints limited immediate full-stack implementation, this strategic work fundamentally altered how Outside approaches product growth:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "North Star" Report:</strong> I authored the strategic white paper that became the reference point for the VP of Product and Engineering leadership.</li>
                <li><strong>Unified Metrics:</strong> We moved from vanity metrics (Account Creates) to value metrics (Reach Rate), now tracked on a shared cross-product dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Unblocking Brand Strategy:</strong> My work highlighted that our "House of Brands" confusion was hurting retention, directly influencing the executive decision to consolidate subscription tiers.</li>
            </ul>
