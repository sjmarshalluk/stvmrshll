                Outside's products had fragmented and inconsistent onboarding experiences. I was tasked with quantifying the problem, and identifying potential opportunities and solutions.
            </p>
            <div class="memo-meta" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                <div class="meta-item">
                    <strong>Role</strong>
                    <span>Project/Design Lead</span>
                </div>
                <div class="meta-item">
                    <strong>Team</strong>
                    <span>Me + CDO</span>

                    <span>Leadership Onboarding Report</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>I was asked to “look into onboarding” across Outside’s portfolio, but quickly found the real problem wasn’t UI—it was that onboarding had no shared definition, ownership, or success metrics. This work reframed onboarding as a value-delivery system, introduced cross-product metrics to make failure visible, and aligned leadership around a common model for guiding users to value across a multi-product ecosystem. </p>
</p>

                <h3 data-figure="fig-02">Measuring the Invisible</h3>
                <p>
                    I was initially asked to "look into onboarding" across Outside's portfolio (Gaia GPS, Trailforks, MapMy). Anecdotally, there were clear issues with onboarding across our products, but there was no tangible evidence that they weren't performing as required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My initial audit exposed that the organization lacked the basic infrastructure to support a cohesive experience:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <li>No Ownership: No single team was responsible for the user's first 30 days.</li>
                    <li>No Definition: "Activation" was measured differently by every product lead.</li>
                    <li>Value Gap: While marketing promised an "Ecosystem," the products operated as silos.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 data-figure="fig-03">Quanitfying the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    I needed to move us from "onboarding needs improving", to something more tangible. To quantify the problem, I constructed 'Value Reach Rate' metrics in Amplitude to demonstrate that onboarding was failing to consistently direct users to value moments across products.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This gave us some clear metrics to improve against, and a north star to align the product teams around.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>~50% of new users don't experience any value in our products</li>
                    <li>&lt;5% new users experience the full value of the product</li>
                    <li>20% of users don't do anything during their free trial</li>
                    <li>Less than 1% of new users adopt more than one Outside product</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 data-figure="fig-04">Reframing the Problem</h3>

                <p>
                    The real onboarding problem wasn't the UI, it was the business definition. We needed to shift from Onboarding as a "intro screens" to Onboarding as a mechanism to guide users to value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I developed a framework to align and direct the product teams. This allowed teams to identify where their individual product onboarding could be improved while bringing them in to be more consistent with each other. It removed the ambiguity of what onboarding is, and what it needs to include.
                </p>

                <h3 data-figure="fig-05">From Abstract to Concrete</h3>
                <p>
                    To prove the framework's viability, I translated the high-level strategy into a "Canonical Flow"—a single architectural diagram that defined the required steps for every product in the portfolio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On top of this, I proposed a universal UI. Due to each each product retaining its unique branding and having strong individual identities, we knew it would be a hard sell to get the teams to adopt a single UI.
                </p>

                <h3 data-figure="fig-06">Organizational Shift and Future Onboarding</h3>
                <p>
                    While resource constraints limited immediate full-stack implementation, this strategic work provided a foundation for future enhancements. Not only did we identify the opportunity onboarding held, we also uncovered systemic issues around product ownership and the packaging of a mulit-product subscription.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The "North Star" Report:</strong> I authored the strategic white paper that became the reference point for the VP of Product and Engineering leadership.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unified Metrics:</strong> We moved from vanity metrics (Account Creates) to value metrics (Reach Rate), now tracked on a shared cross-product dashboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unblocking Brand Strategy:</strong> My work highlighted that our "House of Brands" confusion was hurting retention, directly influencing the executive decision to consolidate subscription tiers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 data-figure="fig-07">Future Opportunities</h3>

                <p>Through establishing a shared definition and framework for onboarding, we not only laid the groundwork for future improvements, we also opened up new avenues for addressing systemic challenges across the product portfolio. Through consistent onboarding experiences across products, we could start to imagine what 'ecosystem onboarding' might look like. This would allow the business to capitalize on having numerous outdoor-focused apps by connecting them and allowing users to explore between them.</p>
