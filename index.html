            <p>
                I navigate ambiguity to build scalable product ecosystems. 
                Currently redefining platform architecture and cross-product strategy.
                My work focuses on the systems that generate the screens, not just the screens themselves.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                At the Staff and Principal level, design ceases to be solely about the artifact and becomes about the <strong>architecture of the outcome</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My practice focuses on de-risking ambiguity—turning vague business goals like "fix onboarding" into concrete, executable systems. I use design to create the maps (frameworks, diagrams, prototypes) that align cross-functional leadership and allow engineering teams to move with velocity.
