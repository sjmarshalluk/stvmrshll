      <h1>Helping the UKs leading printing company explore the potential future of the business card</h1>

      <p>Specializing in online business printing, Moo set up an R&amp;D team to explore future digital-focused opportunities. I joined them in 2016 to work with the Head of Product on their first project: to help define, design, and launch the first version of their digital business card.</p>



      <h2>Scrutinizing the business card</h2>
      

      <p>Our process started with workshops to brainstorm initial ideas, alongside qualitative user interviews to gather user insights and validate some of our early hypothesise. Through this we discovered that many people had (or at least wanted to have) multiple business cards for their different endeavors. Furthermore, the cards they had were often scribbled on with additional information; either by the card owner (wanting to share more information) or the card reciever (wanting to add context).</p>

      <p>With these behaviors identified, we started to workshop how a digital business card could help solve these. Early explorations led us to the concept of 'decks of cards'; infinite&#8212;individual but connected&#8212;cards that allowed the communication of as much or as little information as the user desired. We invited users in to create their own cards with pen and paper in order to validate and refine this direction.</p>

      <h2>Personalization vs legibility</h2>

      <p>Users had told us that personalization was important to them, and so some early wireframes had explored allowing customization of almost any aspect of their cards (eg adding text blocks, changing alignment, etc). However, as we started to create higher fidelity mockups, we realized that too much customization resulted in a jarring and inconsistent viewing experience.</p>

      <img src="./images/moo/customization.png" alt="Hero" loading="lazy" class="col" />

      <p>Having discovered this, we opted for reduced customization. However this presented a new challenge: a lack of personalization and repetitive and boring card decks. To overcome this, I developed an adaptive layout system for cards that allowed for a certain amount of personalization (eg adding images, metadata, etc) that all stuck to a strict template. This enabled the creation of engaging decks without the risk of becoming overwhelming and ineligble.</p>

      <h2>Infinitely Expandable</h2>

      <p>Each card held a discrete piece of information; users could bolt on additional cards to communicate as much or as little information as they wanted to. This allowed users to create a simple deck that mirrored physical business cards (left), or keep adding cards to share anything they wanted.</p>

      <p>This flexibility not only allowed the user to have control over what they shared, but also ensured that we kept a low barrier to entry for first time users. A simple deck would take seconds to create, which they could then return to over time to expand.</p>

      <h2>Education through demonstration</h2>

      <p>The UX of the app was based around our multi-card concept. When viewing cards, our goal was for the interface to be intuitive and enjoyable; encouraging users to swipe up, down, left, and right without having to follow a linear path. Whilst reaching the level of intuition we desired for viewers was one task, another was the in the education of the card creators.</p>

      <p>We knew that if a user had viewed another persons card first, they would understand what to do when creating their own. However, we wanted to ensure that no previous experience of the app was necessary to understand what to do. One option was to just show pre-made example decks (which we also included), but through UI design, we saw opportunities to make it inherently obvious.</p>

      <p>Basing the onboarding sequence around a set of cards started to introduce the user to the concept from the outset. Getting them to swipe left as well as down in order to progress through the educational screens subconciously prepares the user for what is coming.</p>

      <p>This is then solidified through a WYSIWYG interface, allowing the user to create their individual cards in the structure that they will appear in.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>

      <p>In a world where so much of UI design has become formulaic and prescriptive, having the opportunity to base the UX of an app around a central UI led to new and interesting discussions and challenges. This was a fun project that was a catalyst for Moo to embark on many future digital innovations.</p>
