  <h1>Defining a Unified Onboarding Strategy Across Gaia GPS, Trailforks, and MapMy</h1>

  <p>
    Outside’s mapping ecosystem spans several independently built products—Gaia GPS, Trailforks,
    and MapMy—each with its own mental model, feature taxonomy, onboarding flow, and value story.
    As the organization shifted toward a unified subscription offering, it became clear that early
    user experience was fragmented and often worked against ecosystem-level goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was asked to assess whether a single, universal onboarding system could accelerate activation,
    clarify value, and reduce redundant team effort across products. What became clear is that the
    problem was not merely inconsistent UI—it was a lack of shared strategy, ownership, and definition
    of what “onboarding” truly meant within a multi-product ecosystem.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>The Strategic Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Through ecosystem audits, product interviews, and journey analysis, I surfaced several structural
    misalignments that prevented a centralized onboarding flow from being viable:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <strong>No shared value narrative.</strong> Products introduced themselves independently, often
      prioritizing upgrade prompts over first-use comprehension.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Different definitions of “activation.”</strong> Teams measured success differently, making
      cross-product onboarding impossible to standardize.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Brand architecture ambiguity.</strong> It was unclear whether onboarding should orient users
      toward the individual product or the broader Outside ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational constraints.</strong> No central team existed to implement or maintain a unified system.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These findings reframed the initiative: the organization didn’t need a universal onboarding flow.
    It needed a <strong>unifying onboarding strategy</strong> that respected product realities while aligning
    teams around a consistent understanding of user value progression.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>Reframing Onboarding as a Lifecycle, Not a Screen</h2>

  <p>
    A critical insight from Amplitude analysis and UX auditing was that onboarding was being treated as
    a one-time entry experience. In practice, users encountered onboarding opportunities repeatedly as
    they explored maps, searched for content, adjusted tools, or planned trips.
  </p>

  <p>
    To shift this thinking, I defined a <strong>two-layer onboarding model</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)</strong> — the initial value narrative, account access, and upgrade strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>Ongoing Onboarding (OO)</strong> — contextual education, triggered guidance, and reinforcement of core product value.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This structure created a shared language across teams and reframed onboarding as the process of
    helping users reach value—not simply moving them through a flow.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>The Framework</h2>

  <p>
    The outcome was a <strong>modular onboarding framework</strong> that any product could adopt, regardless
    of platform or domain complexity. Rather than impose uniformity, it aligned teams around consistent
    principles while giving flexibility in execution.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Clarifying the User’s Path to Value</h3>

  <p>Each product needed to articulate:</p>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Basic Value</strong> — the minimum behaviors required to understand how the product works.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Value</strong> — the actions that signal sustained usage and future retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Ecosystem Value</strong> — where cross-product opportunities naturally emerge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This replaced siloed onboarding decisions with a structured, comparable understanding of what
    users must learn and when.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Multi-Scenario Onboarding</h3>

  <p>
    I introduced scenario-based onboarding paths based on entry point, subscription status, and prior
    Outside account history. This allowed onboarding to adapt intelligently to:
  </p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>brand-new Outside users</li>
    <li>returning users entering through a different product</li>
    <li>premium or O+ subscribers with established workflows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Shared Structure, Product-Level Execution</h3>

  <p>
    The framework provided a common spine—value communication, intent capture, progressive education,
    and reinforcement—while giving each product latitude to define how those principles manifested in UI.
  </p>

  <hr/>

  <h2>Product-Level Roadmaps</h2>

  <p>
    Although the initiative began as a cross-product system, what teams ultimately needed were
    <strong>clear, product-specific roadmaps</strong> that connected onboarding improvements to the broader
    strategy. I delivered prioritized next steps for each product based on their value moments,
    behavioral data, and technical maturity.
  </p>

  <h3>Gaia GPS</h3>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Recenter onboarding on benefits, not features.</li>
    <li>Introduce value-based triggers for map and planning tools.</li>
    <li>Fix lifecycle email gaps to reinforce learning over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Trailforks</h3>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Shift key explanations earlier in the journey.</li>
    <li>Break long tooltip journeys into contextual steps.</li>
    <li>Clarify permission prompts and safety features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>MapMy</h3>
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Simplify account and upgrade decisions.</li>
    <li>Align OOBE across platforms and reduce redundant education.</li>
    <li>Clarify how MapMy fits into the broader ecosystem.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr/>

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>
      <strong>Created the first unified onboarding framework</strong> adopted across mapping teams,
      replacing inconsistent practices with a shared mental model.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Shifted the company’s approach</strong> from “build a universal onboarding flow” to
      “align on shared principles, then execute within product realities.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enabled parallel improvement</strong> by giving each product a roadmap independent
      of centralized resourcing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Influenced broader organizational discussions</strong> around brand hierarchy,
      cross-product navigation, subscription clarity, and identity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Established instrumentation priorities</strong> that allowed teams to finally benchmark
      value moments and activation behaviors.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While the project did not result in a single universal onboarding system, it delivered something
    more impactful: <strong>a shared strategic foundation</strong> for how Outside introduces value, reduces friction,
    and supports users across a complex product ecosystem.
